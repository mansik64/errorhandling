# errorhandling
This code show us the implementation of Require, Assert and Revert statements.
Basically, require is used for input validation.
assert for checking internal conditions that should never fail.
revert for handling more complex conditions, particularly where multiple checks are involved.

This code simply explain the working of these statement by using update, reset and divide function.
