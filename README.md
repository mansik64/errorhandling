# errorhandling
This code show us the implementation of Require, Assert and Revert statements.
Basically, require is used for input validation.
assert for checking internal conditions that should never fail.
revert for handling more complex conditions, particularly where multiple checks are involved.

This code simply explain the working of these statement by using function to see whether a person of particular age can vote or not. 
It compare the input age with minimum age to vote and also reset the age to 0 when it exceeds the max value i.e. 100 according to the code.
